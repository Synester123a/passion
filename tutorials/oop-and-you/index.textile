On this tutorial you will learn about "Object-oriented Programming":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming ; particularly @MiddleClass@ and @MindState@.

I'll try to make it as friendly as possible, but beware: some theory is ahead. If you feel bored, please feel free to continue with the other tutorials and come back later.
