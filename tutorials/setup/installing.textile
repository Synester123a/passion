The first thing you must do when creating a LÖVE project is prepare a folder for it. We'll assume that you will call your folder @C:\lovegame\@.

*NOTE*: You will have to adapt these instructions if your folder is on some other place.

The first thing you have to do is downloading PÄSSION. There are two main ways to do it:

h3. Option 1 - Git clone (recommended)

Using git is the recommended way of installing, but you need to have it installed in your machine. If you haven't yet, "give it a try":http://git-scm.com/download, it's quite good. If you don't want/can't install git, you can download the zip file directly from github - go to the next section.

Open a terminal and execute the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/kikito/passion.git
{% endhighlight %}

Git should then reach over the internet, download the files and create them for you.

You can confirm that you have done everything ok by checking that now you have a file on  @C:\lovegame\passion\passion.lua@ (and other files and folders inside @C:\lovegame\passion\@).

h3. Option 2 - Compressed file

If you can't use git, you can download this project in either "zip":{{ site.repo_url }}/zipball/master or "tar":{{ site.repo_url }}/tarball/master formats:

p=. "!http://github.com/images/modules/download/zip.png(zip)!":{{ site.repo_url }}/zipball/master "!http://github.com/images/modules/download/tar.png(tar)!":{{ site.repo_url }}/tarball/master


Once you have downloaded it, open it with your favourite uncompressor. You will get a compressed file with a single folder inside it, called something like @kikito-passion-12345@ (with a different number at the end), with some files and folders inside it. Extract that folder on @C:\lovegame\@, and rename the folder to "passion". You should end up having the following folder structure: @C:\lovegame\passion\passion.lua@.

Continue the installation process to configure the "callbacks":../callbacks .
